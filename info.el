  "Enter Info, the documentation browser, for NODE.
NODE is an Info node of the form \"(FILENAME)NODENAME\".  Optional
argument BUFFER specifies the Info buffer name; the default buffer
name is \"*info*\".  If BUFFER exists, just switch to it; otherwise,
create a new buffer with the top-level Info directory.

In interactive use, a numeric prefix argument of N selects an Info
buffer named \"*info*<N>\".

Aside from these differences, this works exactly the same as
`info'."
